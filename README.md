## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)
- A running PostgreSQL instance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd servants-postgresql
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   Ensure your PostgreSQL instance is running. Create the database and run `server/src/postgre/database.sql` to set up all tables and ENUMs. The schema will be automatically applied on server start.

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in all PG_* database values and the other required variables in .env
   ```

4. **Web Client Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL
   ```

5. **Native App Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../native
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL to your backend URL
   ```

### Running the Application Locally

You will need multiple terminal windows to run all parts of the stack.

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Web Client**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Start the Native App**
   ```bash
   cd native
   npx expo start
   # Or use dedicated shortcuts:
   npm run android   # Launch directly on Android emulator
   npm run ios       # Launch directly on iOS simulator
   ```
   Use the Expo Go app on your physical device to scan the QR code, or press `a` for Android emulator / `i` for iOS simulator.

## API & Database

### REST API
The REST API is exposed under `/api` and is organized into the following resource modules:

| Module | Base Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Users | `/api/users` | Registration, login, profile, push token |
| Services | `/api/services` | CRUD for church services |
| Roles | `/api/roles` | Role management per service |
| Assignments | `/api/assignments` | Servant role assignments |
| Chats | `/api/chats` | Chat message history |
| File | `/api/file` | File upload to Cloudinary |

Real-time messaging uses **WebSockets** on the same server instance. The WebSocket endpoint follows this URL pattern:

```
ws://<host>/ws/chats/:serviceId
```

> **WebSocket Note:** The WebSocket URL is derived automatically from `VITE_API_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` by replacing `http` with `ws` (or `https` with `wss`). When deploying behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Render, Nginx), ensure WebSocket upgrade headers are forwarded correctly.

### Database Schema
The backend uses **PostgreSQL** with the following tables and custom ENUM types:

**Tables:**
| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `users` | All registered users (volunteers & admins) |
| `services` | Church services with date, time, and status |
| `roles` | Named roles within a service (with spot counts) |
| `assignments` | Links users to roles with a status |
| `chats` | All chat messages per service (unified chat table) |

**ENUM Types:**
| Type | Values |
|---|---|
| `user_role` | `admin`, `volunteer` |
| `service_status` | `Roles Open`, `Roles Closed` |
| `assignment_status` | `confirmed`, `pending`, `declined` |
| `chat_status` | `success`, `pending`, `failed` |

### Web Routes (Client)

| Route | Page | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Landing | Public |
| `/login` | User Login | Public |
| `/register` | User Registration | Public |
| `/admin/login` | Admin Login | Public |
| `/admin/register` | Admin Registration | Public |
| `/forgot-password` | Forgot Password | Public |
| `/home` | Dashboard | Protected |
| `/schedule` | Schedule | Protected |
| `/openings` | Role Openings | Protected |
| `/chats` | Real-time Chat | Protected |
| `/admin/services` | Manage Services | Admin only |
| `/admin/services/create` | Create a Service | Admin only |
| `/admin/roles` | Manage Roles | Admin only |
| `/admin/admissions` | Manage Admissions | Admin only |
| `/admin/users` | Manage Users | Admin only |

## Authentication & Token Storage

JWTs are issued by the server on login and stored client-side. All protected API requests require the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

| Platform | Storage Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Web | `localStorage` (keys: `token`, `user`) |
| Native | `expo-secure-store` (token) + `AsyncStorage` (user metadata) |

Tokens are validated on every protected route. Expired tokens are automatically cleared and the user is redirected to login.

## Tooling

All three packages (client, server, native) share a consistent tooling setup:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **ESLint** | Code linting (`npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`) |
| **Prettier** | Code formatting (`npm run format`) |
| **TypeScript** | Static typing (client & native) |
| **nodemon** | Server hot-reload in development (`npm run dev`) |
| **pino-pretty** | Human-readable server logs in development |

## Deployment

### Frontend (Web)
Configured for deployment on **Vercel** (`vercel.json` included for routing rewrites). Set `VITE_API_URL` in the Vercel environment variables dashboard.

### Backend
Can be deployed to any Node.js hosting provider (e.g., Render, Railway). Set all required environment variables and ensure the PostgreSQL credentials are correct. In production, environment variables are injected directly — no `.env` file is needed.

### Native App
Configured for **EAS Build** (use `eas.json.example` as a template). Two build profiles are defined:

| Profile | Distribution | Android Output | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `preview` | Internal | APK | Testing on a physical device before release |
| `production` | Store | AAB | App store release (auto-increments version) |

Before triggering a build, copy the EAS configuration template:
```bash
cp eas.json.example eas.json
# Edit eas.json to configure your build profiles and environment variables
```

To trigger a build:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g eas-cli

# Authenticate with your Expo account
eas login

# Initialize the project and link it to your Expo account
# (This will configure the projectId in your app.json)
eas init
# Alternatively, if you already created the project on the Expo dashboard:
# eas init --id <your-project-id>

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile preview
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

> **Note on Android Push Notifications (`google-services.json`):**
> Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is required for Android push notifications. `google-services.json` is **not** committed to this repository. Before running an EAS build, you must:
> 1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and open (or create) the project for this app.
> 2. Download `google-services.json` from **Project Settings → Your apps → Android app**.
> 3. Place it at `native/google-services.json`.
>
> EAS Credentials (`eas credentials`) manages your Android **keystore** and iOS **certificates** — it does **not** handle `google-services.json`. The file must be present locally before running `eas build`.
>
> **FCM Server Setup for EAS Credentials:**
> In addition to `google-services.json`, Expo needs permission to send push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) on your behalf.
> 1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and select your project.
> 2. Navigate to **Project Settings** (gear icon) → **Service accounts** tab.
> 3. Click **Generate new private key** and download the resulting JSON file.
> 4. In your terminal, navigate to the `native` directory and run `eas credentials`.
> 5. Select **Android** → your build profile (e.g., `preview`).
> 6. Select the option to manage **Push Notifications** (FCM Service Account Key) and upload the JSON file you just downloaded.
>    *(Tip: If the file is outside your project folder, you can provide the absolute path when prompted, such as `/Users/yourname/Downloads/your-project-firebase-adminsdk-abc123.json`)*

#### Important Note on Push Notifications and Building
When running the app locally using **Expo Go**, native push notification registration can cause issues or unsupported behavior in the Expo Go sandbox environment. For this reason, the push notification logic has been temporarily commented out for local development.

Specifically, you will find commented code in the following files:
- `native/src/app/_layout.tsx`: Logic for dismissing push notifications when the app transitions from the background to the active state.
- `native/src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`: Logic for registering the device's push notification token and sending it to the backend database.

**Action Required:** When you are ready to actually build the standalone app using EAS, you **must uncomment** the code in both of these files. This ensures that push notifications will work correctly in your production application.
